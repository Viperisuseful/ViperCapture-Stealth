# Self-host ViperCapture Stealth

This repository is the **stealth fork** of
[ViperCapture](https://github.com/Viperisuseful/ViperCapture). It contains the
MIT-licensed rendering engine, browser interface, orchestration APIs,
local/S3-compatible storage, schedules, signed delivery, diagnostics, and
video, with Playwright replaced by Patchright Chromium. The managed
ViperCapture Cloud account, billing, credits, referrals, deployment
configuration, and production secrets remain separate.

## Install locally

Use Python 3.11 or newer and install a full FFmpeg build through the operating
system package manager. Confirm `ffmpeg -encoders` lists `libvpx`, `libvpx-vp9`,
and `libx264`; GPU video additionally requires the vendor encoder and driver.
Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if you can; it is the preferred
dependency installer. Then run `python launch.py`. This is the supported setup
and startup method. The launcher uses uv when it is on `PATH` and otherwise
falls back to pip. It creates a virtual environment, installs Patchright
browsers, starts the application, and opens the local interface.

Install Chrome and/or Chromium yourself when you are not using the launcher:

```bash
python -m patchright install chrome       # sweet-spot / headed Chrome
python -m patchright install chromium     # Docker/CI/headless bundled Chromium
```

`python launch.py` already runs the matching install: `chrome` when
`VIPERCAPTURE_BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome` or the DISPLAY sweet spot is active,
otherwise `chromium`. On Linux, add `--with-deps` if system libraries are
missing.

**Sweet spot vs Docker.** Patchright’s supported sweet spot is persistent
headed Chrome (`VIPERCAPTURE_PATCHRIGHT_SWEETSPOT=1`, or the equivalent
`VIPERCAPTURE_PATCHRIGHT_PERSISTENT=1`, `VIPERCAPTURE_BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome`,
`VIPERCAPTURE_HEADLESS=0`, plus `no_viewport`). That is the path that cleared
public test widgets in A/B. The Docker/GHCR default is headless bundled
Chromium: usable in slim images, but weaker against bot detection. Do not set
`VIPERCAPTURE_HEADLESS=0` in the published image. The image pins
`VIPERCAPTURE_HEADLESS=1`, `VIPERCAPTURE_BROWSER_CHANNEL=chromium`,
`VIPERCAPTURE_PATCHRIGHT_SWEETSPOT=0`, and
`VIPERCAPTURE_PATCHRIGHT_PERSISTENT=0`. On a workstation with `DISPLAY` or
`WAYLAND_DISPLAY` set **outside Docker**, Stealth defaults to that sweet spot;
set `VIPERCAPTURE_PATCHRIGHT_SWEETSPOT=0` to keep headless Chromium. Full knob
table: [Stealth mode / Patchright](../README.md#environment-knobs). The Docker
image already includes FFmpeg. This fork does not install Firefox or WebKit.

## Configure a production deployment

- Put hosted mode behind a rate-limited reverse proxy.
- Run one application process. Chromium starts immediately and can grow into a
  small process pool (`VIPERCAPTURE_BROWSER_POOL_SIZE`, default about half of
  concurrency). Firefox and WebKit are not supported; requests for those
  engines return a validation error.
- Default `VIPERCAPTURE_MAX_CONCURRENCY` is CPU-sized (2–8). Set it to `1`
  until memory and swap pressure are measured on large or full-page captures.
- Keep the default `VIPERCAPTURE_BROWSER_RECYCLE_RENDERS=1000`; it replaces one
  drained browser process after that many render attempts without pausing the
  rest of the pool. Set it to `0` only for controlled diagnostics.
- Image cache TTL defaults to 24 hours (`VIPERCAPTURE_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`).
- Apply container or systemd memory, PID, and CPU limits.
- Enforce network egress rules that block private ranges and cloud metadata endpoints.
- Do not place credentials in the repository or browser-facing JavaScript.
- Put all `/v1/jobs` routes behind the same reverse-proxy authentication as
  `/v1/render`; opaque job IDs are not an authorization mechanism.

## Local render limits

Local installs default to a 500,000,000-pixel budget,
16,384 CSS pixels for either viewport dimension, and 100,000 CSS pixels of
full-page height. The encoded-output ceiling is 1 GiB. These are safety
ceilings. A machine, page, browser build, or image format can fail below these
limits. A decoded
RGBA surface alone needs roughly four bytes per output pixel, and Chromium plus
the encoder need additional working memory. Keep concurrency at one for very
large captures.

Remote self-hosters should size the limits to the container or VM instead of
exposing the local defaults unchanged. For example, this restores conservative
hosted ceilings:

```bash
VIPERCAPTURE_MAX_PIXELS=50000000
VIPERCAPTURE_MAX_WIDTH=7680
VIPERCAPTURE_MAX_HEIGHT=4320
VIPERCAPTURE_MAX_FULL_PAGE_HEIGHT=20000
VIPERCAPTURE_MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES=52428800
VIPERCAPTURE_MAX_CONCURRENCY=1
VIPERCAPTURE_BROWSER_POOL_SIZE=1
VIPERCAPTURE_BROWSER_RECYCLE_RENDERS=1000
VIPERCAPTURE_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=86400
```

Put these values in the `.env` file beside `docker-compose.yml`, or export them
before running `python launch.py`. The effective limits are returned by
`GET /app-config` and enforced for direct renders, async jobs, schedules, bulk
jobs, and viewport packs. Output pixels are approximately
`width × height × device_scale_factor²`; full-page height is measured after the
page finishes loading.

Do not remove the pixel ceiling on an Internet-facing service. Also set an
application memory limit, a request timeout, and low Chromium concurrency so
one extreme page cannot exhaust the host.

## Configure page cleanup and rendering

The local browser interface exposes the Cloud cleanup controls:
reject, accept, hide, or leave cookie consent unchanged; block known ad,
tracker, chat, and newsletter resources or overlays; and apply custom CSS.
Cleanup is opt-in at the API layer and enabled by default only in the
interactive interfaces.

Advanced controls include deterministic device signals, color scheme, reduced
motion, locale and timezone, selector capture, rectangular crop, lazy-content
loading, readiness waits, exact failure statuses, same-origin headers, image
encoding, PDF layout, extraction mode, diagnostics, and video settings. The
API additionally exposes explicit screen/print CSS media, a PDF structure-tag
setting, actions, cookies, proxies, resource patterns,
geolocation, assertions, deterministic time/randomness, slices, profiles,
signed delivery, and certification as documented in [API and workflows](api.md).

## Configure GPU rendering

GPU acceleration is off by default. Self-hosters with a compatible GPU and
driver can set:

```bash
VIPERCAPTURE_GPU_MODE=auto
```

Use `required` instead of `auto` to fail startup unless Chromium reports
hardware GPU compositing through the Chrome DevTools Protocol. On headless
Linux systems where normal graphics autodetection does not work, also try:

```bash
VIPERCAPTURE_GPU_BACKEND=vulkan
```

The host or container must expose the GPU device and its drivers to Chromium
and FFmpeg. The same switch also tries runtime-tested hardware video encoding
through NVENC (NVIDIA), AMF (AMD), Quick Sync (Intel), VideoToolbox (Apple),
Media Foundation (Windows), or VA-API (Linux). Unsupported or unusable encoders
fall back to the existing software path. GIF, transparent WebM, and screenshot
file compression remain CPU encoded; GPU acceleration can still speed the
browser's page compositing and rasterization before those files are encoded.
The Vulkan backend is workload- and driver-dependent, so benchmark it against
the default backend before enabling it permanently. GPU acceleration primarily
helps rasterization, compositing, canvas, and WebGL-heavy pages; navigation,
JavaScript, scrolling waits, and image encoding remain CPU- or network-bound.
The older `VIPERCAPTURE_ENABLE_GPU=1` setting remains supported as an alias for
`VIPERCAPTURE_GPU_MODE=auto`.

### GPU-less Xvfb and software WebGL

Headed Chrome on Xvfb without a GPU often fails WebGL with “no context.”
Upstream OSS Chromium builds sometimes still expose SwiftShader; this fork’s
default `VIPERCAPTURE_GPU_MODE=off` does not. That is a missing GL
implementation, not something to “fix” by spoofing WebGL vendor strings.

On GPU-less headed/Xvfb hosts, opt in to software WebGL:

```bash
VIPERCAPTURE_SWIFTSHADER=1
```

That adds Angle/SwiftShader flags (`--use-gl=angle`, `--use-angle=swiftshader`,
`--enable-unsafe-swiftshader`). It does **not** fake a discrete GPU
fingerprint. If a real GPU is available, prefer `VIPERCAPTURE_GPU_MODE=auto`
instead of SwiftShader. `VIPERCAPTURE_GPU_MODE=required` will still fail when
Chromium is on SwiftShader, because that is software rendering.

The local interface also exposes a **GPU rendering** switch. It drains active
captures, restarts Chromium in `auto` or `off` mode, and reports whether
Chromium verified hardware compositing. For safety, this runtime switch accepts
only same-origin requests from the loopback interface; remotely hosted
instances should continue to configure GPU mode through environment variables
and restart the service normally.

## Feature limits

The public engine implements the feature set documented in [API and workflows](api.md).
It blocks detected page-level challenges by default. Cloudflare Turnstile is
**complete-when-possible** (PRs #5 and #6): locator click through
closed-shadow / `cf-chl-widget-*` frames (not a blind `page.evaluate`), no
false auto-pass on mere `embedded_widget` presence, stale 403 ignored after a
token / success UI / real-content marker, and `stop_when` bound to `page`
so the auto-pass probe cannot TypeError. Interactive Turnstile without a
clickable checkbox still cannot complete without a solver or a human; many
production widgets are the same. Headless Docker/GHCR is weaker and less
reliable than headed persistent Chrome, but there is no headless or
browser-channel guard: if a locator reaches the checkbox and a token or
success marker appears, `handle_challenge()` still accepts the clear.
Callers may set
`proceed_on_captcha: true` to capture the visible challenge as displayed.
ViperCapture does not ship solvers, token farms, WebGL fingerprint spoofing,
or a Cloudflare bypass. See
[Stealth mode / Patchright](../README.md#turnstile-complete-when-possible).

Polling-based jobs are enabled by default and use the same rendering contract,
SSRF controls, concurrency semaphore, and pixel limits as `/v1/render`. The
local defaults keep encrypted state and expiring results under
`~/.vipercapture`. Set `VIPERCAPTURE_ASYNC_JOBS=0` to disable the subsystem, or
follow the [async jobs guide](async-jobs.md) to change retention, capacity, and
providers.

Schedules are enabled by default on Unix hosts. The bundled SQLite schedule
store cannot enforce private ACLs on Windows, so `VIPERCAPTURE_SCHEDULES`
defaults to `0` there and the bundled store refuses direct startup. Use an
external scheduler on Windows or keep the feature disabled.

## Selectors and waits

`selector` captures the first visible matching element and requires
`full_page: false`. `wait_for.selector` accepts `selector_state` values
`visible` (default), `attached`, `hidden`, and `detached`. Both selector fields
accept standard CSS selectors, are limited to 2,048 characters, and do not
support pseudo-elements such as `::before`.

Use `wait_for.event` for `load`, `domcontentloaded`, or `networkidle`.
`wait_for.text` waits for text in the document body, `delay_ms` adds a final
settle delay, and `timeout_ms` bounds page and selector waits. Set
`wait_for.images: true` to eagerly request current lazy images and wait until
all current images complete; full-page renders repeat the bounded image wait
after lazy-content scrolling. The local
interface displays the active wait plan and elapsed time while a render runs.
Cancelling the interface request also cancels queued or active server work.

For full-page captures of unusually wide documents, set
`preserve_viewport_width: true` to clip horizontal overflow to the requested
viewport while retaining the full document height.

## Target-page JavaScript

Set `network.java_script_enabled` to `false` to prevent scripts delivered by
the target page from running. It defaults to `true`. This browser-context
control is separate from `VIPERCAPTURE_ALLOW_SCRIPTS`, which gates caller-
supplied JavaScript actions; disabling either setting does not enable the
other.

## Custom headers

`headers` must be a JSON object whose values are strings. At most 32 headers
and 16 KiB serialized data are accepted; each name is limited to 128 bytes and
each value to 4 KiB. Hop-by-hop, proxy, `Host`, `Content-Length`, `Sec-*`, and
`X-Forwarded-*` headers are managed by ViperCapture and cannot be overridden.

Custom headers are sent only to requests matching the target URL's exact
scheme, hostname, and port. They are stripped from cross-origin subresources
and redirects.

Patchright’s CDP patches (Runtime.enable avoidance, Console API disable,
automation-flag tweaks, closed shadow DOM via locators, init scripts via
Routes) are always active. They are not a CAPTCHA solver, token farm, WebGL
fingerprint spoof, or a custom Cloudflare exploit. If a Cloudflare, CDN, WAF,
or origin rule still blocks captures of a site you administer, use the scoped
pattern in [site access](site-access.md): fixed renderer address, exact host
and path, and an origin-only secret header. It does not disable or evade
challenges on third-party sites.

## Read diagnostic response headers

Successful `POST /v1/render` responses include:

- `X-Request-Id`
- `X-ViperCapture-Queue-Ms`
- `X-ViperCapture-Render-Ms`
- `X-ViperCapture-Width`
- `X-ViperCapture-Height`
- `X-ViperCapture-Navigation-Status`, when navigation returned a response

Dimensions are output pixels after applying the device scale factor.
