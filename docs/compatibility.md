# ScreenshotOne and Urlbox compatibility matrix

## Unsupported managed services

ViperCapture does not provide a managed proxy network, anti-bot bypass, legal
admissibility opinion, SLA, or continuous render support. The operator manages
the code version, browsers, network, data, storage, capacity, and cost.

For a target the operator owns, the [site access guide](site-access.md) documents
a narrow Cloudflare/WAF exception using the renderer address, exact host and
path, and an origin-scoped secret header. This is authorization, not challenge
evasion.

## Other services

- [Browserless](https://docs.browserless.io/enterprise/open-source) provides
  an open-source Docker deployment. It provides general browser infrastructure:
  REST screenshot/PDF/content
  endpoints plus Playwright/Puppeteer WebSocket sessions. ViperCapture Stealth's focus
  is the artifact workflow around rendering—typed actions, encrypted jobs,
  signed delivery, bulk/schedules, visual diffs, and diagnostic bundles.
- [ScreenshotAPI](https://www.screenshotapi.net/docs) documents image/PDF and
  scrolling video output with customization and geolocation as a managed API.
- [ApiFlash](https://apiflash.com/documentation) offers a narrower managed
  URL-to-image GET/POST API backed by AWS Lambda.

ViperCapture is one of several open-source screenshot servers. It provides a
self-hosted rendering and delivery workflow under the MIT License. The matrix
records the tested features and known gaps.
