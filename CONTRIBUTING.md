# Contributing to ViperCapture Stealth

This guide explains how to submit focused fixes, documentation updates, and
small features to the stealth fork of the open-source rendering engine.

This repository is **ViperCapture-Stealth**, a Patchright Chromium fork of
[ViperCapture](https://github.com/Viperisuseful/ViperCapture). Do not open
pull requests against the main OSS repo for stealth-only changes.

## Scope

This repository contains the public rendering engine, JSON API, and local
browser interface. Accounts, authentication, billing, credits, and hosted
infrastructure belong to a separate product and are not accepted here.

Discuss large features or architectural changes in an issue before writing
them. Report security vulnerabilities privately as described in
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Set up the repository

Use Python 3.11 or newer. [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is the preferred
installer
([installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ViperCapture-Stealth.git
cd ViperCapture-Stealth
python launch.py
```

`python launch.py` is the supported setup and startup method. It prefers uv
when uv is on `PATH` to create `.venv` and install from `requirements.txt`,
then installs Patchright Chromium (`python -m patchright install chromium`)
and starts the app. Set `VIPERCAPTURE_BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome` to install
Google Chrome instead. Without uv it falls back to `python -m venv` and pip.
Set `VIPERCAPTURE_USE_UV=0` to force the pip path. Existing pip-only
workflows stay valid:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Prepare a change

Keep the pull request limited to one change. Include:

- What changed and why
- How to reproduce the original problem
- How the change was tested

Preserve the public engine's main security boundaries: public HTTP(S) targets
only, redirect and DNS checks, same-origin routing for custom headers, strict
request validation, and bounded browser work. Never commit secrets, cookies,
private URLs, generated captures, virtual environments, or browser binaries.
Do not add custom Cloudflare exploits, CAPTCHA solving APIs, token farms,
WebGL fingerprint spoofing, or stack `playwright-stealth` on top of
Patchright. Clicking a reachable Turnstile checkbox through Patchright
locators is allowed; claiming a general Cloudflare bypass is not.

The main files are:

- `vipercapture/main.py` — FastAPI application and local interface
- `vipercapture/render_contract.py` — request validation
- `vipercapture/render_engine.py` — Patchright Chromium rendering and network controls
- `vipercapture/render_errors.py` — stable API errors
- `vipercapture/async_jobs.py` — provider-neutral queue contracts and worker lifecycle
- `vipercapture/async_job_providers.py` — bundled SQLite and filesystem adapters
- `templates/` and `static/` — local browser interface

## Check a change

Build the frontend and run the Chromium smoke check before submitting:

```bash
npm ci --prefix frontend
npm run lint --prefix frontend
npm run build --prefix frontend
.venv/bin/python -m patchright install --with-deps chromium
.venv/bin/python scripts/smoke.py
```

On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\python`, omit `--with-deps`, and run the same
Patchright and smoke commands. Keep checks deterministic and avoid relying on
live third-party websites.
