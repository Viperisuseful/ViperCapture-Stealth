<p align="center"><strong>Stealth fork of ViperCapture, powered by Patchright.</strong></p>

This is the **stealth fork** of [ViperCapture](https://github.com/Viperisuseful/ViperCapture)
(OSS 1.0.3). It keeps the same `/v1/render` JSON contract and logo assets, but
replaces Playwright with [Patchright](https://github.com/Kaliiiiiiiiii-Vinyzu/patchright-python),
a Chromium-only Playwright drop-in that patches CDP leaks used by Cloudflare
and other WAFs.

- Upstream OSS: https://github.com/Viperisuseful/ViperCapture
- This fork: https://github.com/Viperisuseful/ViperCapture-Stealth
- Published image: `ghcr.io/viperisuseful/vipercapture-stealth`

The product version stays **1.0.3** to match the upstream contract line. Fork
identity lives in the product name, image, and this README—not a confusing
version scheme.

ViperCapture Stealth is an MIT-licensed browser renderer for infrastructure
you control. Send a URL, HTML, or Markdown and receive screenshots, PDFs,
AVIF images, WebM/MP4/GIF video, hydrated HTML, Markdown, or structured
metadata through a JSON API.

## Stealth, Cloudflare, and WAF

Stealth comes from **Patchright’s supported surface**, not custom exploits:

- Avoids Playwright’s `Runtime.enable` leak by evaluating JavaScript in
  isolated execution contexts
- Disables the Console API to avoid `Console.enable` leaks (diagnostic
  `console.json` may be empty)
- Tweaks automation flags (`--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled`,
  removes `--enable-automation` and other detectable defaults)
- Interacts with closed shadow DOM through normal locators
- Injects init scripts via Playwright Routes instead of `Runtime.enable`

This fork does **not** ship CAPTCHA solvers, Cloudflare challenge bypasses,
token farms, or `playwright-stealth` stacked on Patchright. When a Cloudflare
Turnstile checkbox is reachable through Patchright frames/locators (including
closed shadow / `cf-chl-widget-*` iframes that `page.evaluate` cannot see),
Stealth clicks it with a human-like mouse path and waits for a token, success
UI, or real-content bypass marker. An embedded Turnstile widget is **not**
treated as already passed. Interactive Turnstile on many production sites can
still remain after an honest click; that is an inherent challenge, not a
product failure you can “bypass.” Detected challenges that do not clear still
return `captcha_detected` unless you opt into `proceed_on_captcha` (capture as
shown) or an operator-approved external handler. For sites you administer,
keep using the least-privilege
[Cloudflare/WAF authorization guide](docs/site-access.md). Do not treat this
fork as a general Cloudflare bypass.

### Headed Chrome vs headless Docker

Patchright’s strongest **supported** setup is **headed Google Chrome** with a
persistent profile, native window size, and no custom user-agent
(`launch_persistent_context`, `channel="chrome"`, `headless=False`,
`no_viewport=True`). Headless Chromium in slim images is weaker and more
detectable. The GHCR/Docker default still uses **headless bundled Chromium**
and `launch()` + `new_context()` so `ghcr.io/viperisuseful/vipercapture-stealth`
is usable without a display or system Chrome. CI stays on that path.

| Knob | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VIPERCAPTURE_BROWSER_CHANNEL` | `chromium` | Set `chrome` when Google Chrome is installed (`patchright install chrome`) |
| `VIPERCAPTURE_HEADLESS` | `1` | Set `0` for headed mode when a display is available. Do not force headed in Docker. |
| `VIPERCAPTURE_PATCHRIGHT_PERSISTENT` | `0` | Opt in to `launch_persistent_context` with a durable `user_data_dir` |
| `VIPERCAPTURE_PATCHRIGHT_NO_VIEWPORT` | off unless persistent headed Chrome | Use the real window instead of a fixed viewport |
| `VIPERCAPTURE_PATCHRIGHT_SWEETSPOT` | auto when `DISPLAY` is set **and** not Docker; else `0` | Composite: persistent + headed Chrome + `no_viewport`. Explicit `=0` or `=1` wins. Docker/GHCR stay headless Chromium. |
| `VIPERCAPTURE_SWIFTSHADER` | `0` | Software WebGL on GPU-less Xvfb. Does not spoof GPU fingerprints. |
| `VIPERCAPTURE_TURNSTILE_CLICK` | `1` | Click a reachable Turnstile checkbox; disable to detect-only |
| `VIPERCAPTURE_TURNSTILE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | Budget for auto-pass wait, checkbox click, and backoff retries |

When `DISPLAY` (or `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`) is set on a workstation **outside Docker**,
those sweet-spot defaults apply automatically (persistent + `chrome` + headed +
`no_viewport`). Set `VIPERCAPTURE_PATCHRIGHT_SWEETSPOT=0` to keep headless
bundled Chromium. Headed mode is **not** forced in Docker/GHCR: the image pins
`VIPERCAPTURE_HEADLESS=1`, `VIPERCAPTURE_BROWSER_CHANNEL=chromium`, and
`VIPERCAPTURE_PATCHRIGHT_SWEETSPOT=0`. Dockerfile also pins
`VIPERCAPTURE_PATCHRIGHT_PERSISTENT=0`.

This fork is **Chromium-only**. Requests with `engine: "firefox"` or
`"webkit"` are rejected. Firefox and WebKit are not installed.

## Before you begin

Direct installation requires Python 3.11 or newer and a full FFmpeg build on
`PATH`. Video output needs the `libvpx`, `libvpx-vp9`, and `libx264` encoders;
GPU video also needs the matching hardware encoder and driver. Use your OS
package manager or the [FFmpeg download page](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
Run `ffmpeg -encoders` to confirm the encoders are available. The Docker image
already includes FFmpeg.

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is the preferred way to install Python
dependencies. It is optional: `python launch.py` still works with pip when uv
is not on `PATH`.

## Install locally

Install uv first if you can
([installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows, use `irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex` in PowerShell.
Then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Viperisuseful/ViperCapture-Stealth.git
cd ViperCapture-Stealth
python launch.py
```

The launcher prefers uv when it is on `PATH`: it creates `.venv` and installs
from `requirements.txt`. If uv is missing, it falls back to the standard
library `venv` module and pip. Set `VIPERCAPTURE_USE_UV=0` to force that pip
path even when uv is installed. The launcher then installs Patchright
Chromium, starts the API, and opens `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Set
`VIPERCAPTURE_BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome` and `VIPERCAPTURE_HEADLESS=0` before
`python launch.py` when you want headed Chrome.

To use Docker instead, run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Stable container images are also published to GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/viperisuseful/vipercapture-stealth:1.0.3
```

The image defaults to headless bundled Chromium. That is weaker than headed
Chrome but keeps GHCR usable on servers without a display.

By default, Compose binds only to loopback. It keeps durable queue state,
encryption keys, schedules, cache entries, and local artifacts in a named
volume. Read [self-hosting](docs/self-hosting.md) before exposing the service to
a network. Set separate `VIPERCAPTURE_ADMIN_TOKEN` and
`VIPERCAPTURE_CONTROL_SECRET` values to enable the built-in project control
plane before exposing API routes to multiple tenants.

## Send a render request

```bash
curl --fail-with-body http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/render \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "output": "png",
    "full_page": false,
    "viewport": {"width": 1280, "height": 720},
    "actions": [{"type": "hide", "selector": ".newsletter"}],
    "cleanup": {"block_ads": true, "consent_mode": "reject"},
    "assertions": {"content_includes": ["Example Domain"]}
  }' --output example.png
```

A synchronous request returns the artifact directly. The
`X-ViperCapture-*` headers include the request ID, queue and render timing,
dimensions, navigation status, and cache outcome.

For work that must survive a dropped connection, send the same render object to
`POST /v1/jobs`. Poll
`GET /v1/jobs/{id}`, download `GET /v1/jobs/{id}/result`, or receive a signed
callback by setting `delivery.webhook_url`. Related orchestration endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /v1/jobs/bulk` | Best-effort submission of up to 100 independently idempotent jobs |
| `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /v1/schedules` | Encrypted five-field cron schedules with IANA time zones |
| `POST /v1/signed-url` | Mint an expiring HMAC render link |
| `GET /v1/render/signed` | Render through a verified signed link |
| `POST /v1/diff` | Compare two images and download a deterministic report ZIP |
| `PUT/GET/POST /v1/baselines` | Store project baselines and compare review bundles |
| `POST/DELETE /v1/profiles` | Manage encrypted Playwright storage-state profiles |
| `POST /v1/profiles/import` | Import pasted Cookie headers or browser-exported session files |
| `GET /take` | ScreenshotOne-compatible common-options adapter |
| `POST /compat/urlbox/v1/render/{sync,async}` | Urlbox-compatible adapters |

See the [API and workflows guide](docs/api.md), [async provider guide](docs/async-jobs.md),
[platform/operator guide](docs/platform.md),
[public API deployment](deploy/public-api), and
[migration guide](docs/migration-screenshotone-urlbox.md). If a site you
administer challenges the renderer, use the least-privilege
[Cloudflare/WAF authorization guide](docs/site-access.md).

## Use proxies, sessions, and CAPTCHA hooks

Self-hosted renders can route an isolated browser context through an HTTP,
HTTPS, SOCKS4, or SOCKS5 proxy. Keep credentials in separate fields instead of
embedding them in the proxy URL:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "network": {
    "proxy": {
      "server": "socks5://proxy.example:1080",
      "username": "account-zone-residential",
      "password": "secret"
    }
  }
}
```

With the project control plane enabled, `POST /v1/profiles/import` normalizes
Playwright storage state, Cookie-Editor JSON, Netscape `cookies.txt`, or a
pasted Cookie header into an encrypted profile. Pass its returned `id` as
`profile_id` on later renders. Imports preserve local storage and partitioned
cookies where the export format supports them.

ViperCapture Stealth detects common blocking CAPTCHA and bot interstitials.
For Cloudflare Turnstile it will click a reachable “Verify you are human”
checkbox through Patchright locators/frames and wait for the widget to pass or
go away, then settle briefly and retry that click once. It does **not** call
solver APIs, mint tokens, or implement a Cloudflare bypass. Interactive
Turnstile can still remain after an honest click. The default `captcha.action`
is `error`; use `capture` to render the uncleared challenge as-is. Operators
may configure their own approved async handler with
`VIPERCAPTURE_CAPTCHA_HANDLER_FACTORY` and opt in per request with
`captcha.action: "external"`. See the [API guide](docs/api.md) for the handler
contract and timeout behavior. Alternatively, an authorized caller can use an
external tool independently, then start a fresh render with short-lived,
target-scoped session state. This fork ships no provider integration,
credentials, endorsement, solver, or bypass service.

## Configure storage and webhooks

Set `VIPERCAPTURE_S3_BUCKET` to store job results through the built-in S3
adapter instead of local files. It uses standard AWS credential resolution.
R2 and MinIO also need an endpoint URL and, where appropriate, path-style
addressing. The `docker-compose.s3.yml` overlay provides a complete local MinIO
example:

```bash
export MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD='replace-with-at-least-a-long-random-secret'
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.s3.yml up --build
```

Set `VIPERCAPTURE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to enable callbacks. Each callback contains
canonical JSON signed with HMAC-SHA256 in
`X-ViperCapture-Webhook-Signature`. Timestamp and event-ID headers support
verification and deduplication. Private callback targets are rejected unless
the operator explicitly opts in. Public DNS results stay pinned for the life
of the callback connection to prevent rebinding, and the encrypted delivery
outbox survives process restarts.

## Secure the service

Keep the service on loopback, enable `VIPERCAPTURE_ADMIN_TOKEN`, or put every
route behind the same authenticated, rate-limited reverse proxy. When the
control plane is disabled, job and schedule UUIDs identify resources but do
not provide access control. Hosted mode rejects targets and redirects that
resolve to private addresses during validation, along with unsafe subresources,
cross-origin credential headers, proxy use, and cross-site cookies. Browser DNS
can change after validation, so deployments also need host or container egress
rules to block rebinding. Self-host mode allows internal pages and
proxies; isolate Chromium with that boundary in mind.

JavaScript actions are disabled unless `VIPERCAPTURE_ALLOW_SCRIPTS=1`. Render
inputs can contain credentials and private page data. Async and scheduled inputs
are AES-GCM encrypted and erased at terminal job states, but diagnostic console
output and browser video can still record sensitive page content. Treat those
artifacts accordingly.

## Verify an installation

```bash
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python -m patchright install --with-deps chromium
npm ci --prefix frontend && npm run lint --prefix frontend && npm run build --prefix frontend
.venv/bin/python scripts/smoke.py
```

Without uv, use `python -m venv .venv` and
`.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` instead, then the same
Patchright, frontend, and smoke commands. On Windows, use
`.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` and
`.venv\Scripts\python` for Patchright and smoke, and omit `--with-deps` from
the Patchright command. On macOS, omit `--with-deps`.
The smoke command starts a temporary local server and verifies Chromium,
OpenAPI, health, output dimensions, and that Firefox/WebKit are rejected. Pass
`--base-url http://host:port` to check an existing deployment instead. For an
authenticated deployment, set `VIPERCAPTURE_SMOKE_TOKEN` to an API or
administrator token.

For headed Chrome on a workstation with a display:

```bash
VIPERCAPTURE_BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome VIPERCAPTURE_HEADLESS=0 \
  VIPERCAPTURE_PATCHRIGHT_PERSISTENT=1 \
  .venv/bin/python -m patchright install chrome
```

On GPU-less Xvfb, headed Chrome often reports WebGL “no context”. Set
`VIPERCAPTURE_SWIFTSHADER=1` for software WebGL, or `VIPERCAPTURE_GPU_MODE=auto`
when a real GPU is present. That enables a GL implementation; it does not
spoof a GPU fingerprint. Docker/GHCR should keep `VIPERCAPTURE_HEADLESS=1`.
